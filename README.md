### Project Description
A useless chatbot is a funny or sarcastic bot designed to give unhelpful, irrelevant, or mocking replies. It doesn‚Äôt solve problems‚Äîjust entertains by being intentionally unproductive .


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting way too many correct answers from AI. It‚Äôs overwhelming. They‚Äôre becoming too productive. So, we created a chatbot that solves this non-problem by being completely useless ‚Äî finally, a bot that won‚Äôt help you at all. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We proudly present a chatbot that replies with sarcasm, nonsense, or the exact opposite of what you want. Ask it anything ‚Äî it‚Äôll respond in another language, give a useless fact, or just roast you. Finally, a chatbot as unhelpful as your group chat admin.
